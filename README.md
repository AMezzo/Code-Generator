# Assignment 3 Documentation

## Scope of Work

Mark each of the requirements you completed by adding an X in between the square brackets. If you have any comments for a given section, add them in the "Comments from student" section (i.e. I almost finished this, but 3 tests aren't passing).

| Requirement                              | Completed? | Comments from student |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1. Byte codes generated for Iterate Tree | [X]        |                       |

## Results and Conclusions

### How I Verified My Implementation Was Correct

I verified the iterateTree method by comparing the generated bytecode to a simple.x program, ensuring that it matched the expected behavior. I conducted multiple tests using different simple.x programs to ensure compatibility across various scenarios.

### What I Learned

I've learned a lot, specifically about how "load" and "store" operations work, and I've also gained an understanding of the general logic required for the iterateTree class.

### Challenges I Encountered

The hardest parts were figuring out how to handle the loop, deal with the count, and work with different bytecodes. Making sure the logic worked correctly and knowing when and how to use it turned out to be more complicated than I expected.
